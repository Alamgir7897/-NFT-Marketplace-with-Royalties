Prerequisites
Node.js & npm

Hardhat installed (npm install --save-dev hardhat)

Create a .env file in the root directory:

PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
RPC_URL=https://goerli.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key (optional for contract verification)
Install dependencies

npm install
Compile contracts

npx hardhat compile
Deploy to local Hardhat network

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
Deploy to a testnet (e.g., Goerli)

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
Verify on Etherscan (optional)
If you set up the ETHERSCAN_API_KEY in .env, the script will attempt contract verification automatically after deployment.
